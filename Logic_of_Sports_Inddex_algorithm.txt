File Used: Ball to Ball IPL data
Objective: Calculate and assign weights to batsmen/bowlers

Strike Rate, Average are calculated by grouping the table on batsmen and summing the runs and balls.

Runs per ball, balls per wicket are calculated for the bowlers.

A min max scaler is then used to scale the values between 0 to 1.

scaled_value = x-min(x)/max(x)-min(x)

File Used: Ball to Ball IPL data
Objective: Calculate scores for 3 ball intervals


For Batsmen
Pivot the table on match player and match ID
Calculate bins(intervals of 3 ball periods), group the runs for 3 ball intervals and calculate the total runs
We now have runs for every 3 ball period, for every game, for every batsmen.
Calculate the average of all 3 ball periods across games.
Store key, value pair in dictionary where key is player name and value is 3 ball interval values and the number of innings played in the 3 ball periods.

For Bowler

Pivot the table on match player and match ID
Calculate bins(intervals of 3 ball periods), group the runs for 3 ball intervals and calculate the total runs
We now have runs for every 3 ball period, for every game, for every bowler.
Calculate the average of all 3 ball periods across games  
Store key, value pair in dictionary where key is player name and value is 3 ball interval values.

We calculate the average number of dismissals/wickets for a bowler and store it in a dictionary.

In Game Mechanics - In Progress



We store 3 ball response from the API in a dataframe and compare the dataframe to our calculated average value.

For Batsmen
If batsman dismissed
	Calculate dismissal weight by dividing innings dismissed in ball period with the total innings.
	Value generated will be from 0 to 1.
	With batsmen getting out earlier in the evenings having a score closer to 1.
Else
	Dismissal weight is 0

Divide actual runs with mean runs and for every 3 ball period, subtract a penalty of 0.85(constant).
Obtain a sum of all the values and subtract the dismissal weight from the calculated sum.

We now obtain a score(percentage change) for a given batsmen.

For Bowler
Economy score = actual_runs in 3 ball period divided by mean runs in 3 ball periods and add all the values
If bowler takes wicket:
	Divide number of wickets by expected wickets and add it to the economy score

else:
	Consider the economy score only
